# Web-Scraping-Mubawab.ma  

This project is a **fork** of an existing repository. It focuses on scraping real estate data from the [Mubawab.ma search page](https://www.mubawab.ma/fr/st/casablanca/appartements-a-vendre). This search link contains multiple pages of property listings.  

## Project Overview  

The provided Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the following:  

1. **Scraping Search Results**  
   - Navigates through all pages of the search results.  
   - Extracts links to individual property announcements along with preliminary data about each listing.  

2. **Scraping Announcement Pages**  
   - Visits each announcement's page to collect every available detail.  

3. **Data Organization**  
   - Organizes all extracted information into a pandas DataFrame.  

4. **Saving Data**  
   - Exports the final dataset to an Excel file for further analysis or use.  

This project showcases a complete workflow for extracting, organizing, and storing data from a dynamic website.
